<h2>THE IRISH MIDWIFE.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Part II.</span><br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<p>The village of Ballycomaisy was as pleasant a little place as
one might wish to see of a summer’s day. To be sure, like
all other Irish villages, it was remarkable for a superfluity of
“pigs, praties, and childre,” which being the stock in
trade of an Irish cabin, it is to be presumed that very few villages
either in Ireland or elsewhere could go on properly
without them. It consisted principally of one long street,
which you entered from the north-west side by one of those
old-fashioned bridges, the arches of which were much more
akin to the Gothic than the Roman. Most of the houses were
of mud, a few of stone, one or two of which had the honour
of being slated on the front side of the roof, and rustically
thatched on the back, where ostentation was not necessary.
There were two or three shops, a liberal sprinkling of public-houses,
a chapel a little out of the town, and an old dilapidated
market-house near the centre. A few little bye-streets
projected in a lateral direction from the main one, which was
terminated on the side opposite to the north-west by a pound,
through which, as usual, ran a shallow stream, that was
gathered into a little gutter as it crossed the road. A crazy
antiquated mill, all covered and cobwebbed with grey mealy
dust, stood about a couple of hundred yards out of the
town, to which two straggling rows of houses, that looked
like an abortive street, led you. This mill was surrounded by
a green common, which was again hemmed in by a fine river,
that ran round in a curving line from under the hunchbacked
arch of the bridge we mentioned at the beginning. Now, a
little behind, or rather above this mill, on the skirt of the
aforesaid common, stood a rather neat-looking whitish cabin,
with about half a rood of garden behind it. It was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
small, and consisted merely of a sleeping-room and kitchen.
On one side of the door there was a window, opening
on hinges; and on the outside, to the right as you entered
the house, there was placed a large stone, about four
feet high, backed by a sloping mound of earth, so graduated
as to allow a person to ascend the stone without any difficulty.
In this cabin lived Rose Moan, the Midwife; and we need
scarcely inform our readers that the stone in question was
her mounting-stone, by which she was enabled to place herself
on pillion or crupper, as the case happened, when called out
upon her usual avocation.</p>

<p>Rose was what might be called a <i lang="ga">flahoolagh</i>, or portly woman,
with a good-humoured set of Milesian features; that
is to say, a pair of red, broad checks, a well-set nose, allowing
for the disposition to turn up, and two black twinkling eyes,
with a mellow expression that betokened good nature, and a
peculiar description of knowing <em>professional</em> humour that is
never to be met with in any <em>but</em> a Midwife. Rose was dressed
in a red flannel petticoat, a warm cotton sack or wrapper,
which pinned easily over a large bust, and a comfortable
woollen shawl. She always wore a long-bordered morning
cap, over which, while travelling, she pinned a second shawl
of Scotch plaid; and to protect her from the cold night air,
she enfolded her precious person in a deep blue cloak of the
true indigo tint. On her head, over cloak and shawl and
morning cap, was fixed a black “splush hat,” with the leaf
strapped down by her ears on each side, so that in point of
fact she cared little how it blew, and never once dreamed that
such a process as that of Raper or Mackintosh was necessary
to keep the liege subjects of these realms warm and waterproof,
nor that two systems should exist in Ireland so strongly
antithetical to each other as those of Raper and Father
Mathew.</p>

<p>Having thus given a brief sketch of her local habitation
and personal appearance, we shall transfer our readers to
the house of a young new-married farmer named Keho, who
lived in a distant part of the parish. Keho was a comfortable
fellow, full of good nature and credulity; but his wife
happened to be one of the sharpest, meanest, most suspicious,
and miserable devils that ever was raised in good-humoured
Ireland. Her voice was as sharp and her heart as cold as
an icicle; and as for her tongue, it was incessant and interminable.
Were it not that her husband, who, though
good-natured, was fiery and resolute when provoked, exercised
a firm and salutary control over her, she would have
starved both him and her servants into perfect skeletons.
And what was still worse, with a temper that was vindictive
and tyrannical, she affected to be religious, and upon
those who did not know her, actually attempted to pass
herself off as a saint.</p>

<p>One night, about ten or twelve months after his marriage,
honest Corny Keho came out to the barn, where slept
his two farm servants, named Phil Hannigan and Barny
Casey. He had been sitting by himself, composing his mind
for a calm night’s sleep, or probably for a curtain lecture,
by taking a contemplative whiff of the pipe, when the servant
wench, with a certain air of hurry, importance, and
authority, entered the kitchen, and informed him that Rose
Moan must immediately be sent for.</p>

<p>“The misthress isn’t well, Masther, an’ the sooner she’s
sint for, the betther. So mind my words, sir, if you plaise,
an’ pack aff either Phil or Barny for Rose Moan, an’ I
hope I won’t have to ax it again&mdash;hem!”</p>

<p>Dandy Keho&mdash;for so Corny was called, as being remarkable
for his slovenliness&mdash;started up hastily, and having
taken the pipe out of his mouth, was about to place it on
the hob; but reflecting that the whiff could not much retard
him in the delivery of his orders, he sallied out to the
barn, and knocked.</p>

<p>“Who’s there? Lave that, wid you, unless you wish to
be shotted.” This was followed by a loud laugh from within.</p>

<p>“Boys, get up wid all haste: it’s the misthress. Phil,
saddle Hollowback and fly&mdash;(puff)&mdash;fly in a jiffy for Rose
Moan; an’ do you, Barny, clap a back-sugaun&mdash;(puff)&mdash;an
Sobersides, an’ be aff for the Misthress’s mother&mdash;(puff.)”</p>

<p>Both were dressing themselves before he had concluded,
and in a very few minutes were off in different directions,
each according to the orders he had received. With Barny
we have nothing to do, unless to say that he lost little time
in bringing Mrs Keho’s mother to her aid; but as Phil is gone
for a much more important character, we beg our readers to
return with us to the cabin of Rose Moan, who is now fast
asleep; for it is twelve o’clock of a beautiful moonlight night,
in the pleasant month of August. Tap-tap. “Is Mrs Moan at
home?” In about half a minute her warm good-looking face,
enveloped in flannel, is protruded from the window.</p>

<p>“Who’s that, <em>in God’s name</em>?” The words in italics were
added, lest the message might be one from the fairies.</p>

<p>“I’m Dandy Keho’s servant&mdash;one of them, at any rate&mdash;an’
my Misthress has got a stitch in her side&mdash;ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Aisy, avick&mdash;so, she’s <em>down</em>, thin&mdash;aisy&mdash;I’ll be wid you
like a bow out of an arrow. Put your horse over to ‘the
stone,’ an’ have him ready. The Lord bring her over her
difficulties, any way, amin!”</p>

<p>She then pulled in her head, and in about three or four
minutes sallied out, dressed as we have described her; and
having placed herself on the crupper, coolly put her right arm
round Phil’s body, and desired him to ride on with all possible
haste.</p>

<p>“Push an, avouchal, push an&mdash;time’s precious at all times,
but on business like this every minute is worth a life. But
there’s always one comfort, that God is marciful. Push
forrid, avick.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, Mrs Moan. If it’s in Hollowback, bedad
I’m the babe that’ll take it out of him. Come, ould Hack-ball,
trot out&mdash;you don’t know the message you’re an, nor
who you’re carryin’.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t your misthress&mdash;manin’ the Dandy’s wife&mdash;a daughter
of ould Fitzy Finnegan’s, the schrew of Glendhu?”</p>

<p>“Faith, you may say that, Rose, as we all know to our
cost. Be me song, she does have us sometimes that you might
see through us; an’ only for the masther&mdash;&mdash;but, dang it, no
matther&mdash;she’s down now, poor woman, an’ it’s not just the
time to be rakin’ up her failins.”</p>

<p>“It is not, an’ God mark you to grace for sayin’ so. At a
time like this we must forget every thing, only to do the
best we can for our fellow-creatures. What are you lookin’
at, avick?”</p>

<p>Now, this question naturally arose from the fact that honest
Phil had been, during their short conversation, peering keenly
on each side of him, as if he expected an apparition to rise
from every furze-bush on the common. The truth is, he was
almost proverbial for his terror of ghosts and fairies, and all
supernatural visitants whatever; but upon this occasion his
fears arose to a painful height, in consequence of the popular
belief, that, when a midwife is sent for, the Good People
throw every possible obstruction in her way, either by laming
the horse, if she rides, or by disqualifying the guide from
performing his duty as such. Phil, however, felt ashamed to
avow his fears on these points, but still could not help unconsciously
turning the conversation to the very topic he
ought to have avoided.</p>

<p>“What war you looking at, avick?”</p>

<p>“Why, bedad, there appeared something there beyant,
like a man, only it was darker. But be this and be that&mdash;hem,
ehem!&mdash;if I could get my hands on him, whatsomever
he”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hushth, boy, hould your tongue: you don’t know but
it’s the very word you war goin’ to say might do us harm.”</p>

<p>“&mdash;Whatsomever he is, that I’d give him a lift on Hollowback
if he happened to be any poor fellow that stood in need of it.
Oh! the sorra word I was goin’ to say against any thing or
any body.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, dear. If you knew as much as I could tell
you&mdash;push an&mdash;you’d have a dhrop o’ sweat at the ind of
every hair on your head.”</p>

<p>“Be my song, I’m tould you know a power o’ quare things,
Mrs Moan; an’ if all that’s said is thrue, you sartinly do.”</p>

<p>Now, had Mrs Moan and her heroic guide passed through
the village of Ballycomaisy, the latter would not have felt
his fears so strong upon him. The road, however, along
which they were now going was a grass-grown <i lang="ga">bohreen</i>, that
led them from behind her cabin through a waste and lonely
part of the country; and as it was a saving of better than
two miles in point of distance, Mrs Moan would not hear of
their proceeding by any other direction. The tenor of her
conversation, however, was fast bringing Phil to the state
she so graphically and pithily described.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Phil Hannigan, a son of fat Phil’s of Balnasaggart, an’
a cousin to Paddy who lost a finger in the Gansy (Guernsey)
wars.”</p>

<p>“I know. Well, Phil, in throth the hairs ’ud stand like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
stalks o’ barley upon your head, if you heard all I could
mintion.”</p>

<p>Phil instinctively put his hand up and pressed down his hat,
as if it had been disposed to fly from off his head.</p>

<p>“Hem! ahem! Why, I’m tould it’s wonderful. But is it
thrue, Mrs Moan, that you have been brought <em>on business</em> to
some o’ the”&mdash;here Phil looked about him cautiously, and
lowered his voice to a whisper&mdash;“to some o’ the fairy women?”</p>

<p>“Husth, man alive&mdash;what the sorra timpted you to call
them anything but the Good People? This day’s Thursday&mdash;God
stand betune us an’ harm. No, Phil, I name nobody.
But there was a woman, a midwife&mdash;mind, avick, that I don’t
say <em>who</em> she was&mdash;may be I know why too, an’ may be it would
be as much as my life is worth”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Aisey, Mrs. Moan! God presarve us! what is that tall
thing there to the right!”&mdash;and he commenced the Lord’s
Prayer in Irish as fast as he could get out the words.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see, boy, its a fir-tree, but sorra movin’
it’s movin.”</p>

<p>“Ay, faix, an’ so it is; bedad I thought it was gettin’ taller
an’ taller. Ay!&mdash;hut! it <em>is</em> only a tree.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, there was a woman, an’ she was called away
one night by a little gentleman dressed in green. I’ll tell you
the story some time&mdash;only this, that havin’ done her <em>duty</em>, an’
tuck no payment, she was called out the same night to a neighbour’s
wife, an’ a purtier boy you couldn’t see than she left
behind her. But it seems she happened to touch one of his
eyes wid a hand that had a taste of <em>their</em> panado an it; an’
as the child grew up, every one wondhered to hear him speak
of the multitudes o’ thim that he seen in all directions. Well,
my dear, he kept never sayin’ anything to them until one day
when he was in the fair of Ballycomaisy, that he saw them
whippin’ away meal and cotton and butther, an’ everything that
they thought serviceable to them; so you see he could hould in
no longer, an’ says he to a little fellow that was very active
an’ thievish among them, ‘Why duv you take what doesn’t
belong to you?’ says he. The little fellow looked up at him”&mdash;“God
be about us, Rose, what is that white thing goin’ along
the ditch to the left of us?”</p>

<p>“It’s a sheep, don’t you see? Faix, I believe you’re cowardly
at night.”</p>

<p>“Ay, faix, an’ so it is, but it looked very quare somehow.”</p>

<p>“&mdash;An’ says he, ‘How do you know that?’ ‘Bekase I see
you all,’ says the other. ‘An’ which eye do you see us all
wid?’ says he again. ‘Why, wid the left,’ says the boy.
Wid that he gave a short whiff of a blast up into the eye, an’
from that day not a stime the poor boy was never able to see
wid it. No, Phil, I didn’t say it was <em>myself</em>&mdash;I named <em>nobody</em>.”</p>

<p>“An’, Mrs Moan, is it thrue that you can put the dughaughs
upon them that trate their wives badly?”</p>

<p>“Whisht, Phil. When you marry, keep your timper&mdash;that’s
all.&mdash;You knew long Ned Donnelly?”</p>

<p>“Ay, bedad, sure enough; there was quare things said
about”&mdash;&mdash;“Push an, avick, push an; for who knows how
some of us is wanted? You have a good masther, I believe,
Phil? It’s poison the same Ned would give me if he could.
Push an, dear.”</p>

<p>Phil felt that he had got his answer. The abrupt mystery
of her manner and her curt allusions left him little indeed to
guess at. In this way did the conversation continue, Phil feloniously
filching, as he thought, from her own lips, a corroboration
of the various knowledge and extraordinary powers
which she was believed to possess, and she ingeniously feeding
his credulity, merely by enigmatical hints and masked
allusions; for although she took care to affirm nothing directly
or personally of herself, yet did she contrive to answer
him in such a manner as to confirm every report that had gone
abroad of the strange purposes she could effect.</p>

<p>“Phil, wasn’t there an uncle o’ yours up in the Mountain
Bar that didn’t live happily for some time wid his wife?”</p>

<p>“I believe so, Rose; but it was before my time, or any
way when I was only a young shaver.”</p>

<p>“An’ did you ever hear how the reconcilement came betune
them?”</p>

<p>“No, bedad,” replied Phil, “I never did; an’ that’s no
wondher, for it was a thing they never liked to spake of.”</p>

<p>“Throth, it’s thrue for you, boy. Well, I brought about&mdash;&mdash;Push
an, dear, push an.&mdash;They’re as happy a couple now
as breaks bread, any way, and that’s all they wanted.</p>

<p>“I’d wager a thirteen it was you did that, Rose.”</p>

<p>“Hut, gorsoon, hould your tongue. Sure they’re happy
now, I say, whosomever did it. I named nobody, nor I take
no pride to myself, Phil, out o’ sich things. Some people’s
gifted above others, an’ that’s all. But, Phil?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“How does the Dandy an’ his scald of a wife agree? for,
throth, I’m tould she’s nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Faix, but middlin’ itself. As I tould you, she often has
us as empty as a paper lanthern, wid divil a thing but the light
of a good conscience inside of us. If we <em>pray</em> ourselves, begorra
she’ll take care we’ll have the <em>fastin’</em> at first cost; so
that you see, ma’am, we hould a devout situation undher her.”</p>

<p>“An’ so that’s the way wid you?”</p>

<p>“Ay, the downright thruth, an’ no mistake. Why, the
stirabout she makes would run nine miles along a deal boord,
an’ scald a man at the far end of it.”</p>

<p>“Throth, Phil, I never like to go next or near sich women
or sich places, but for the sake o’ the innocent we must forget
the guilty. So push an, avick, push an. Who knows but
it’s life an’ death wid us? Have you ne’er a spur on?”</p>

<p>“The divil a spur I tuck time to wait for.”</p>

<p>“Well, afther all, it’s not right to let a messager come for
a woman like me, widout what is called the Midwife’s Spur&mdash;a
spur in the head&mdash;for it has long been said that one in the
head is worth two in the heel, an’ so indeed it is,&mdash;on business
like this, any way.”</p>

<p>“Mrs Moan, do you know the Moriartys of Ballaghmore,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Which o’ them, honey?”</p>

<p>“Mick o’ the Esker Beg.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do. A well-favoured dacent family they are,
an’ full o’ the world too, the Lord spare it to them.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, they are, ma’am, a well-favoured<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> family. Well,
ma’am, isn’t it odd, but somehow there’s neither man, woman,
nor child in the parish but gives you the good word above all
the women in it; but as for a midwife, why, I heard my
aunt say that if ever mother an’ child owended their lives to
another, she did her and the babby’s to you.”</p>

<p>The reader may here perceive that Phil’s flattery must have
had some peculiar design in it, in connection with the Moriartys,
and such indeed was the fact. But we had better allow
him to explain matters himself.</p>

<p>“Well, honey, sure that was but my duty; but God be
praised for all, for every thing depinds on the Man above.
She should call in one o’ those newfangled women who take
out their Dispatches from the Lying-in College in Dublin below;
for you see, Phil, there is sich a place there&mdash;an’ it
stands to raison that there should be a Fondlin’ Hospital beside
it, which there is too, they say; but, honey, what are
these poor ignorant cratures but <em>new lights</em>, every one o’ them,
that a dacent woman’s life isn’t safe wid?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Mrs Moan; an’ everyone knows they’re not
to be put in comparishment wid a woman like you, that knows
sich a power. But how does it happen, ma’am, that the
Moriartys does be spakin’ but middlin’ of you?”</p>

<p>“Of me, avick?”</p>

<p>“Ay, faix; I’m tould they spread the mouth at you sometimes,
espishily when the people does be talkin’ about all the
quare things you can do.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, dear, let them have their laugh&mdash;they may
laugh that win, you know. Still one doesn’t like to be provoked&mdash;no
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Faix, an’ Mick Moriarty has a purty daughther, Mrs
Moan, an’ a purty penny he can give her, by all accounts.
The nerra one o’ myself but would be glad to put my comedher
on her, if I knew how. I hope you find yourself aisey on your
sate, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I do, honey. Let them talk, Phil, let them talk; it may
come their turn yet&mdash;only I didn’t expect it from <em>them</em>. You!
but, avick, what chance would <em>you</em> have with Mick Moriarty’s
daughther?”</p>

<p>“Ay, every chance an’ sartinty too, if some one that I
know, and that every one that knows her, respects, would
only give me a lift. There’s no use in comin’ about the bush,
Mrs Moan&mdash;bedad it’s yourself I mane. You could do it.
An’, whisper, betune you and me it would be only sarvin’
them right, in regard of the way they spake of you&mdash;sayin’,
indeed, an’ galivantin’ to the world that you know no more
than another woman, an’ that ould Pol Doolin of Ballymagowan
knows oceans more than you do.”</p>

<p>This was perhaps as artful a plot as could be laid for engaging
the assistance of Mrs Moan in Phil’s design upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Moriarty’s daughter. He knew perfectly well that she would
not, unless strongly influenced, lend herself to any thing of
the kind between two persons whose circumstances in life differed
so widely as those of a respectable farmer’s daughter
with a good portion, and a penniless labouring boy. With
great adroitness, therefore, he contrived to excite her prejudices
against them by the most successful arguments he could
possibly use, namely, a contempt for her imputed knowledge,
and praise of her rival. Still she was in the habit of acting
coolly, and less from impulse than from a shrewd knowledge
of the best way to sustain her own reputation, without undertaking
too much.</p>

<p>“Well, honey, an’ so you wish me to assist you? Maybe
I could do it, and maybe&mdash;But push an, dear, move him an;
we’ll think of it, an’ spake more about it some other time.
I must think of what’s afore me now&mdash;so move, move, acushla;
push an.”</p>

<p>Much conversation of the same nature took place between
them, in which each bore a somewhat characteristic part; for
to say truth, Phil was as knowing a “boy” as you might wish
to become acquainted with. In Rose, however, he had a
woman of no ordinary shrewdness to encounter; and the consequence
was, that each after a little more chat began to understand
the other a little too well to render the topic of the
Moriartys, to which Phil again reverted, so interesting as it
had been. Rose soon saw that Phil was only a <i lang="ga">plasthey</i>, or
sweetener, and only “soothered” her for his own purposes;
and Phil perceived that Rose understood his tactics too well
to render any further tampering with her vanity either safe or
successful.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at Dandy Keho’s house, and in a
moment the Dandy himself took her in his arms, and, placing
her gently on the ground, shook hands with and cordially
welcomed her. It is very singular, but no less true, that the
moment a midwife enters the house of her patient, she always
uses the plural number, whether speaking in her own person
or in that of the former.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, Rose, an’ I’m proud an’ happy to see
you here, an’ it’ll make poor Bridget strong, an’ give her
courage, to know you’re near her.”</p>

<p>“How are we, Dandy? how are we, avick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bedad, middlin’, wishin’ very much for you of coorse,
as I hear”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, honey, go away now. I have some words to say
afore I go in, that’ll sarve us, maybe&mdash;a charm it is that has
great vartue in it.”</p>

<p>The Dandy then withdrew to the barn, where the male portion
of the family were staying until the <i lang="la">ultimatum</i> should be
known. A good bottle of potteen, however, was circulating
among them, for every one knows that occasions of this nature
usually generate a festive and hospitable spirit.</p>

<p>Rose now went round the house in the direction from east
to west, stopping for a short time at each of the windows,
which she marked with the sign of the cross five times; that
is to say, once at each corner and once in the middle. At
each corner also of the house she signed the cross, and repeated
the following words or charm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">The four Evangels and the four Divines,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">God bless the moon an us when it shines.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">New moon,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> true moon, God bless me,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">God bless this house an’ this family.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Matthew, Mark, Luke, an’ John,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">God bless the bed that she lies on.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">God bless the manger where Christ was born,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">St Bridget an’ St Patrick, an’ the holy spouse,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Keep the fairies for ever far from this house. Amen.</div>
<div class="verse">Glora yea, Glora yea, Glora yea yeelish,</div>
<div class="verse">Glora n’ahir, Glora n’vac, Glora n’spirid neev. Amen.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are the veritable words of the charm, which she uttered
in the manner and with the forms aforesaid. Having
concluded them, she then entered into the house, where we
leave her for a time with our best wishes.</p>

<p>In the barn the company were very merry, Dandy himself
being as pleasant as any of them, unless when his brow became
shaded by the very natural anxiety for the welfare of
his wife and child, which from time to time returned upon him.
Stories were told, songs sung, and jokes passed, all full of
good nature and not a little fun, some of it at the expense of
the Dandy himself, who laughed at and took it all in good part.
An occasional <i lang="fr">bulletin</i> came out through a servant maid, that
matters were just the same way; a piece of intelligence which
damped Keho’s mirth considerably. At length he himself was
sent for by the Midwife, who wished to speak with him at
the door.</p>

<p>“I hope there’s nothing like danger, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, honey; but the truth is, we want a seventh
son who isn’t left-handed.”</p>

<p>“A seventh son! Why, what do you want him for?”</p>

<p>“Why, dear, just to give her three shakes in his arms;&mdash;it
never fails.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, an’ that’s fortunate; for there’s Mickey M’Sorley
of the Broad Bog’s a seventh son, an’ he’s not two gunshots
from this.”</p>

<p>“Well, aroon, hurry off one or two o’ the boys for him, and
tell Phil, if he makes haste, that I’ll have a word to say to
him afore I go.” This intimation to Phil put feathers to his
heels; for from the moment that he and Barny started, he
did not once cease to go at the top of his speed. It followed
as a matter of course that honest Mickey M’Sorley dressed
himself and was back at Keho’s house before the family
believed it possible the parties could have been there. This
ceremony of getting a seventh son to shake the sick woman,
in cases where difficulty or danger may be apprehended, is one
which frequently occurs in remote parts of the country. To
be sure, it is only a form, the man merely taking her in his
arms, and moving her gently three times. The writer of
this, when young, saw it performed with his own eyes, as the
saying is; but in his case the man was not a seventh son, for
no such person could be procured. When this difficulty arises,
any man who has the character of being lucky, provided he
is not married to a red-haired wife, may be called in to give
the three shakes. In other and more dangerous cases Rose
would send out persons to gather half a dozen heads of blasted
barley; and having stripped them of the black fine powder
with which they were covered, she would administer it in
a little new milk, and this was always attended by the best
effects. It is somewhat surprising that the whole Faculty
should have adopted this singular medicine in cases of similar
difficulty, for in truth it is that which is now administered
under the more scientific name of <em>Ergot of rye</em>.</p>

<p>In the case before us, the seventh son sustained his reputation
for good luck. In about three quarters of an hour
Dandy was called in “to kiss a strange young gintleman that
wanted to see him.” This was an agreeable ceremony to
Dandy, as it always is, to catch the first glimpse of one’s own
first-born. On entering he found Rose sitting beside the bed
in all the pomp of authority and pride of success, bearing the
infant in her arms, and dandling it up and down, more from
habit than any necessity that then existed for doing so.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “here we are all safe and sound, God
willin’; an’ if you’re not the father of as purty a young man
as ever I laid eyes on, I’m not here. Corny Keho, come an’
kiss your son, I say.”</p>

<p>Corny advanced, somewhat puzzled whether to laugh or
cry, and taking the child up with a smile, he kissed it five
times&mdash;for that is the mystic number&mdash;and as he placed it
once more in Rose’s arms, there was a solitary tear on its
cheek.</p>

<p>“Arra, go an’ kiss your wife, man alive, an’ tell her to
have a good heart, an’ to be as kind to all her fellow-creatures
as God has been to her this night. It isn’t upon this world
the heart ought to be fixed, for we see how small a thing an’
how short a time can take us out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bedad,” said Dandy, who had now recovered the
touch of feeling excited by the child, “it would be too bad if
I’d grudge her a smack.” He accordingly stooped, and
kissed her; but, truth to confess, he did it with a very cool
and business-like air. “I know,” he proceeded, “that she’ll
have a heart like a jyant, now that the son is come.”</p>

<p>“To be sure she will, an’ she must; or if not, <em>I’ll</em> play the
sorra, an’ break things. Well, well, let her get strength a
bit first, an’ rest and quiet; an’ in the mean time get the
groanin’-malt ready, until every one in the house drinks the
health of the stranger. My sowl to happiness, but he’s a born
beauty. The nerra Keho of you all ever was the aiquails of
what he’ll be yet, plaise God. Troth, Corny, he has daddy’s
nose upon him, any how. Ay, you may laugh; but, faix, it’s
thrue. You may take with him, you may own to him, any
where. Arra, look at that! My soul to happiness, if one
egg’s liker another! Eh, my posey! Where was it, alanna?
Ay, you’re there, my duck o’ diamonds! Troth, you’ll be the
flower o’ the flock, so you will. An’ now, Mrs Keho, honey,
we’ll lave you to yourself awhile, till we thrate these poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
cratures of sarvints; the likes o’ them oughtn’t to be overlooked;
an’ indeed they did feel a great dale itself, poor things,
about you; an’ moreover they’ll be longin’ of coorse to see the
darlin’ here.”</p>

<p>Mrs Keho’s mother and Rose superintended the birth-treat
between them. It is unnecessary to say that the young men
and girls had their own sly fun upon the occasion; and now
that Dandy’s apprehension of danger was over, he joined in
their mirth with as much glee as any of them. This being
over, they all retired to rest; and honest Mickey M’Sorley
went home very <em>hearty</em>,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in consequence of Dandy’s grateful
sense of the aid he had rendered his wife. The next morning
Rose, after dressing the infant and performing all the usual
duties that one expected from her, took her leave in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs Keho, God bless you an’ yours, and take care
of yourself. I’ll see you agin on Sunday next, when it’s to be
christened. Until then, throw out no dirty wather before sunrise
or afther sunset; an’ when Father Molloy is goin’ to
christen it, let Corny tell him not to forget to christen it
<em>against the fairies</em>, an’ thin it’ll be safe. Good bye, ma’am;
an’ look you to her, Mrs Finnegan,” said she, addressing her
patient’s mother, “an’ <i lang="ga">banaght lath</i> till I see all again.”</p>

<h3>No. VI.&mdash;THE REMORSE OF A NIGHT.</h3>

<p>The last night of the year was about to expire; the winds,
after a day of storminess, had subsided into slumber; the
white earth lay outspread, like a shrouded map, under the
moon; and innumerable stars arose out from the remotest
abysses of heaven, twinkling as brightly as though they had
but then begun their existence, and were never to suffer impairment.
Eleven o’clock had tolled from the tower of an
ancient Gothic church; and as the vibrations died away on
the transparent air, an Old Man drew nigh to the window of
a dark room in the desolate dwelling of which he had long
been the solitary tenant, and cast his dull despairful eyes upwards
towards the immoveable firmament, and from thence
down on the blank waste of the earth, and then breathed a
groaning prayer, that those eyes might never survey that firmament
or that earth again. Wretched was he, in truth,
that Old Man, beyond all parallel and beyond all consolation&mdash;for
his grave lay open for him, as it seemed, by his side; it
was thinly covered over, not by the flowers of Youth, but by
the snows of Age; and when, heartsick of the sight, he looked
away from it into himself, he saw that the sole fruits that he
had gathered from a long and eventful life were sins, regrets,
and maladies&mdash;a decayed body, a plague-smitten soul, a bosom
full of bitterness, and an old age full of remorse. The
beautiful days of his youth now came again before him like
ghosts, and resummoned to his remembrance the cheerful
morning upon which his venerable father had first placed
him upon the great Cross-road of Life&mdash;a road which, trodden
on the right hand, conducts the pilgrim along the noonday
path of Virtue into a spacious, joyous land, abounding
in sunbeams, harvests, and angelic spirits, but which, followed
on the left, betrays him through lampless and miry ways, into
the rueful wildernesses of Vice, where serpents for ever swarm,
and pestilence chokes the atmosphere, and to quench his burning
thirst the sluggish black rivers yield him but slime and
poison.</p>

<p>Alas! the serpents were now coiled about him&mdash;the poison
was rilling through his heart! Alas for him! he knew too
well which road he had chosen&mdash;where he was&mdash;and what he
must undergo&mdash;for eternity&mdash;for eternity!</p>

<p>With an anguish, with an agony, with a despair, that language
cannot even faintly pourtray, he uplifted his withered
arms towards heaven, clasped his hands, and cried aloud,
O! give me back, give me back my youth! O! my father,
lead me once more to the Cross-road, that I may once more
choose, and this time choose with foreknowledge!</p>

<p>But his cries wasted themselves idly upon the frozen air,
for his father was no more, and his youth was no more&mdash;both
had alike long, long ago evanished, never to reappear. He
knew this, and he wept&mdash;yes, that miserable old man wept;
but his tears relieved him not; they were like drops of hot
lava, for they trickled from a burning brain.</p>

<p>He looked forth, and he saw flitting lights&mdash;wills-o’-the-wisp&mdash;dancing
over the morasses and becoming extinguished
in the burial-grounds; and he said, Such were my riotous
days of folly! He again looked forth, and he beheld a star
fall from heaven to earth, and there melt away in blackness
that left no trace behind, and he said, I am that star!&mdash;and
with that woeful thought were torn open anew the leprous
wounds in his bosom which the serpents that clung around
him would never suffer to be healed.</p>

<p>His morbid imagination, wandering abroad till it touched
on the confines of frenzy, showed him figures of sleep-walkers
traversing like shadows the roofs of the houses:&mdash;the chimneys
widened into furnaces vomiting forth flames and monsters&mdash;the
windmills lifted up their giant arms, and threatened to
crush him&mdash;and a forgotten spectre, left behind in a deserted
charnel-house, glared on him with a horrible expression of
malignity, and then mocked his terror by assuming his
features.</p>

<p>On a sudden there flowed out upon the air a deep, rich, and
solemn stream of music. It came from the steeple of the old
Gothic church, as the bells announced the birth of the new
year, for it was now the twelfth hour. Its cadences fell with
a thrilling distinctness upon the ear and the heart of the Old
Man; and every tone in the melody, through the agency of
that mysterious power which sound possesses of re-assembling
within the forsaken halls of the soul images long departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
brought before his mind some past scene of his life, vivid as a
panoramic picture. Again he looked round upon the lucid
horizon and over the frosted earth; and he thought on the
opportunities he had forfeited&mdash;the warnings he had slighted&mdash;the
examples he had scoffed at. He thought upon the friends
of his youth, and how they, better and more fortunate than
he, were now good men, at peace with themselves&mdash;teachers
of wisdom to others, fathers of blessed families, torchlights
for the world&mdash;and he exclaimed, Oh! and I also, had I but
willed it, I also might, like them, have seen with tearless
eyes, with tranquil heart, this night depart into eternity!
Oh, my dear father&mdash;my dear, dear mother! I, even I, might
have been now happy, had I but hearkened to your affectionate
admonitions&mdash;had I but chosen to profit by the blessings which
on every returning New Year’s Morn like this your tenderness
led you to invoke on my head!</p>

<p>Amid these feverish reminiscences of his youth, it appeared
to him as though the spectre which had assumed his features
in the charnel-house gradually approached nearer and nearer
to him&mdash;losing, however, as it advanced, one trait after another
of its spectral character&mdash;till at length, as if under the
dominion of that supernatural influence which on the last
night of the old year is popularly said to compel even the
Dead to undergo a change of form, it took the appearance of
a living young man&mdash;the same young man that he had himself
been fifty years before.</p>

<p>He was unable to gaze any longer: he covered his face
with his hands; and, as the blistering tears gushed from his
eyes, he sank down, powerless and trembling, on his knees&mdash;and
again he cried out, as if his heart would break, O! come
back to me, lost days of my youth!&mdash;come back, come back
to me once more!</p>

<p>And the supplication of the Penitent was not made in vain,
for they came back to him, those days of his youth, but not
yet lost! He started from his bed&mdash;the blue moonbeams
were shining in through the windows&mdash;the midnight chimes
were announcing the beginning of a new year. Yes!&mdash;all had
been but an appalling dream&mdash;all, except his sins and transgressions:
these, alas! were but too real, for conscience,
even in sleep, is a faithful monitor. But he was still young&mdash;he
had not grown old in iniquity&mdash;and with tears of repentance
he thanked God for having, even by means of so terrific
a vision, awakened in his heart a feeling of horror for the
criminal career he had been pursuing, and for having revealed
to him in that glimpse of a land full of sunbeams, harvests,
and angelic spirits, the blissful goal in which, if he pleased,
the path of his existence might yet terminate.</p>

<p>Youthful reader! on which of these two paths art thou?
On the right-hand path? Go forward, then, with the blessing
of thy Maker, and fear nothing! On the left-hand path?
If so, pause: be forewarned&mdash;turn while yet thou mayest&mdash;retrace
thy steps&mdash;make a happier choice! I will pray that
the terrors of this ghastly Dream may not hereafter be arrayed
in judgment against thee! Alas for thee, if the time ever
come when thou shalt call aloud in thy despair, Come back,
ye precious days of my youth!&mdash;unlike the dreamer, <em>thou</em> wilt
but be mocked by the barren echo of thine own lamentation&mdash;the
precious days of thy youth will never, never come back to
thee!</p>

<h2 class="gap4">TEETOTALLERS AND TOPERS.</h2>

<p>It is not a little curious, and perhaps not a little amusing in
its way, to mark the feelings with which these two very different
classes contemplate each other. The introduction of
teetotallism was a thing for which the toper was wholly
unprepared. It was a thing of which, <i lang="la">a priori</i>, he could have
formed no conception&mdash;a thing of which he never dreamt.
It therefore took him quite by surprise; and when it came,
his opinion of it was, and to this good hour is, that it is one
of the most absurd and monstrous ideas that ever entered
into the human head.</p>

<p>That a class of men should arise who would forswear the
use of those exhilarating stimulants in which he himself so
much delighted&mdash;that there should ever appear on the face
of the earth such an ass as the man who would refuse a glass
of generous liquor when offered him, is to him a thing surpassing
belief; and in fact he does not, or rather will not,
believe in it. He insists upon it that it is all humbug,
and that its professors, the professors of teetotallism, may
say what they please, but that they can and do take their
drink as freely as he does; the only real difference being, that
they take theirs secretly. No evidence whatever will convince
him that it is otherwise, or at least will induce him to admit
that it is so. He is, in short, determined not to believe in so
monstrous a doctrine. But should conviction at any time be
too strong for him, he then falls back on the consolatory belief
that it cannot long prevail&mdash;that it will not, can not
stand. An association whose rules should enjoin every member
always to walk backwards instead of forwards, or which
should enjoin any other equally ridiculous absurdity, might
live and prosper; but teetotallism, the abstaining from the
dear potations&mdash;no, no, <em>that</em> cannot stand any time&mdash;ridiculous,
impossible&mdash;not in the nature of things.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the toper entertains a most cordial
hatred of the teetotaller; he abhors him, and detests his
principles&mdash;he in fact cannot hear him spoken of with any degree
of patience. Oh, what a triumph to him when he catches
a teetotaller tripping! With what delight he treasures up
anecdotes of backsliding on the part of the professors of abstinence!
And of such anecdotes he has a large store; for
he is constantly on the look-out for them, and is not very particular
on the score of authenticity. With what glee he relates
these anecdotes to his club! and with what glee his club
listens to the edifying and refreshing relation! They will
chuckle over a story of this kind for a month. Nor, in the
matter of anecdote, is the teetotaller a whit behind his unregenerated
brother. The two parties, in fact, carry on a war
of anecdote against each other&mdash;the teetotaller’s being stories of
ruin and misery resulting from dissipation&mdash;the toper’s, facetious
little tales of hypocrisy and backsliding. Both collect
their anecdotes with great industry, and propagate them with
great zeal and diligence.</p>

<p>The toper’s attitude, as regards the teetotaller, is of course
a hostile one. But it is not a bold one. There is nothing of
defiance in it, although he sometimes affects it. For although
he hates the teetotaller, he also stands in awe of him; being
oppressed with an awkward consciousness that the latter has
the right side of the argument, and the weight of general
opinion is on his side&mdash;that, in short, the teetotaller is right
and he is wrong.</p>

<p>This consciousness gives to his hostility a sneaking and
timid character, and induces him to confine himself in the
matter of retaliation to the facetious joke and sly insinuation.
On more open warfare he dare not venture. The teetotaller
is thus the assailing party: he takes and keeps the field
manfully, and with bold front and loud voice dares the toper
to the combat. The latter, in conscious weakness, shrinks
at the sound, as do the small animals of the forest when they
hear the roar of the lion; and getting out of his way as fast
as he can, retires to his fastnesses, the drinking-shops, and
hedges himself round with bottles and quart-pots.</p>

<p>The toper always carefully eschews any thing like direct
and open personal contact with the enemy, in the shape of
discussions on the merits of the question of abstinence.
There is, in fact, nothing he so much abominates as any attempt
at reasoning on the subject, where such reasoning has for
its object to show the advantages of temperance or intemperance.
The toper thus at all times prefers keeping out of the
teetotaller’s way, and, although professing the most entire
disregard of him, will at any time go a mile about to avoid
him. He has an instinctive dislike of him, and this because
he is a living personified reflection on himself.</p>

<p>Turning now to the teetotaller, we find two or three
things in his conduct, too, with reference to the toper, that
are rather curious in their way. In the first place, it is curious
to mark the deep interest he takes in what may be called the
tippling statistics of his neighbourhood; and the amount of
knowledge which he contrives to acquire on this subject is
really amazing. He knows all the topers in his vicinity, and
keeps a sharp eye on their proceedings. He knows every one
of their haunts too&mdash;knows the different degrees of dissipation
to which each has attained, and could almost tell on any
given day what quantity each drank on the preceding night.
In short, so vigilantly does he watch all the outgoings and
incomings of these marked men, and yet without seeming to
notice them, that they can hardly swallow a single <em>cropper</em>
without his knowing it. The whole thing, in fact, is a sort
of private study of his own, and one to which he devotes a
great deal of quiet observation and secret reflection: he takes
a deep interest in it, and hence the proficiency he makes out
in the knowledge of its details.</p>

<p>But our teetotaller not only knows all the professed, undisguised
topers of his locality; he knows&mdash;much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
striking proof of his vigilance&mdash;every man also whose habits,
although not yet sufficiently intemperate to attract the attention
of any one but a teetotaller, exhibit signs and
symptoms of becoming gradually worse. The tippling progress
of these persons he watches with the deepest interest,
and keeps himself accurately informed regarding the extent
and frequency of their debauches. The teetotaller, in short,
keeps a vigilant eye over the entire drinking system of his
neighbourhood, and professes an astonishing knowledge of
what every one is doing in this way. If the teetotaller’s
residence be in a small town, his surveillance then embraces
its whole extent, and hardly can a single bumper be swallowed
within its limits, of which he does not, somehow or other,
obtain notice.</p>

<p>Abhorring dissipation itself, the teetotaller naturally extends
that abhorrence to its signs and symptoms. On flushed
and pimpled faces he looks with aversion and distrust, but on
a red nose with absolute horror. We once saw a curious instance
of this:&mdash;A gentleman with a highly illumed proboscis
one evening entered a teetotal coffee-room in which we
happened to be seated. The nose&mdash;for we sink the gentleman,
its owner, altogether, as an unnecessary incumbrance&mdash;passed,
although with deliberate movement, like a fiery meteor,
up the entire length of the room, exciting in its progress the
utmost horror and dismay amongst the teetotallers with whom
the apartment was thronged. The sensation, in fact, created
by the red nose was immense, although not noisy in its expression.</p>

<p>It was indicated merely by an extensive and earnest whispering,
by a shuffling of feet, and a general fidgetty sort of
movement, giving, though in an unobtrusive form, a very vivid
idea of the presence of some exceedingly disagreeable object.
The whole room, in short, was shocked by the red nose,
although they refrained from expressing that feeling by any
more marked demonstration than those we have mentioned.
The red nose seemed for some time unconscious of the effects
it was producing, but the detection of a number of horror-stricken
faces peering eagerly over the edges and round the
corners of boxes, to get a glimpse of the detestable object,
betrayed the real state of the case. The red nose, however,
evinced no emotion on making the discovery, but passed quietly
into an unoccupied box, took up a paper, and ordered a
glass of lemonade. The landlord looked queer at the nose
as he tabled the order, but of course said nothing.</p>

<p>Now, we thought at the time, how different would have been
the reception of the gentleman with the red nose by a club of
topers! In such case, his nose, in place of being looked on
with horror, would have been viewed with respect. It would
have been a passport to the highest favour of the jolly fraternity,
and would have at once admitted its owner to their confidence
and good-fellowship. We do not know, indeed, that
its entrance would not have been hailed by a shout of acclamation;
for, viewed as one of the chief insignia of a boon companion,
it was truly a splendid nose.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">MORAL EVIL MAN’S OWN CREATION.</h2>

<p>Man brings upon himself a thousand calamities, as consequences
of his artifices and pride, and then, overlooking his
own follies, gravely investigates the origin of what he calls
evil:&mdash;</p>

<p>He compromises every natural pleasure to acquire fame
among transient beings, who forget him nightly in sleep, and
eternally in death; and seeks to render his name celebrated
among posterity, though it has no identity with his person,
and though posterity and himself can have no contemporaneous
feeling.</p>

<p>He deprives himself and all around him of every passing
enjoyment, to accumulate wealth that he may purchase other
men’s labour, in the vain hope of adding happiness to his own.</p>

<p>He omits to make effective laws to protect the poor against
the oppressions of the rich, and then wears out his existence
under the fear of becoming poor, and being the victim of his
own neglect and injustice.</p>

<p>He arms himself with murderous weapons; and on the
slightest instigation, and for hire, practises murder as a
science, follows this science as a regular profession, and
honours its chiefs above benefactors and philosophers, in proportion
to the quantity of blood they have shed, or the mischiefs
they have perpetrated.</p>

<p>He disguises the most worthless of the people in showy
liveries, and then excites them to murder men whom they
never saw, by the fear of being killed if they do not kill.</p>

<p>He revels in luxury and gluttony, and then complains of
the diseases which result from repletion.</p>

<p>He tries in all things to counteract or improve the provisions
of nature, and then afflicts himself at his disappointments.</p>

<p>He multiplies the chances against his own life and health by
his numerous artifices, and then wonders at their fatal results.</p>

<p>He shuts his eyes against the volume of truth as presented
by Nature, and, vainly considering that all was made for
him, founds on this false assumption various doubts in regard
to the justice of eternal causation.</p>

<p>He interdicts the enjoyment of all other creatures, and regarding
the world as his property, in mere wantonness destroys
myriads on whom have been bestowed beauties and perfections.</p>

<p>He forgets that to live and let live is a maxim of universal
justice, extending not only to his fellow creatures, but to inferior
ones, to whom his moral obligations are greater, because
they are more in his power.</p>

<p>He afflicts himself that he cannot live for ever, though his
forefathers have successively died to make room for him.</p>

<p>He repines at the thought of losing that life, the use of which
he so often perverts: and though he began to exist but yesterday,
thinks the world was made for him, and that he ought
to continue to enjoy it for ever.</p>

<p>He desires to govern others, but, regardless of their dependence
upon his benevolence, is commonly gratified in displaying
the power entrusted to him by a tyrannical abuse of it.</p>

<p>He makes laws, which, in the hands of mercenary lawyers,
serve as snares to unwary poverty&mdash;but as shields to crafty
wealth.</p>

<p>He acknowledges the importance of educating youth, yet
teaches them any thing but their social duties in the political
state in which they live.</p>

<p>He passes his days in questioning the providence of Nature,
in ascribing evil to supernatural causes, in feverish expectation
of results contrary to the necessary harmony of the world.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The Labour of Study.</span>&mdash;It is impossible for any man
to be a determined student without endangering his health.
Man was made to be active. The hunter who roams through
the forest, or climbs the rocks of the Alps, is the man who is
hardy, and in the most robust health. The sailor who has
been rocked by a thousand storms, and who labours day and
night, is a hardy man, unless dissipation has broken his constitution.
Any man of active habits is likely to enjoy good
health, if he does not too frequently over-exert himself. But
the student’s habits are all unnatural, and by them nature is
continually cramped and restrained. Men err in nothing
more than in the estimate which they make of human labour.
The hero of the world is the man that makes a bustle&mdash;the
man that makes the road smoke under his chaise-and-four&mdash;the
man that raises a dust about him&mdash;the man that ravages
or devastates empires. But what is the real labour of this
man, compared with that of a silent sufferer? He lives on
his projects: he encounters, perhaps, rough roads, incommodious
inns, bad food, storms and perils; but what are
these? His project, his point, the thing that has laid hold on
his heart&mdash;glory&mdash;a name&mdash;consequence&mdash;pleasure&mdash;wealth&mdash;these
render the man callous to the pains and efforts of the
body. I have been in both states, and therefore understand
them; and I know that men form this false estimate. Besides,
there is something in bustle, and stir, and activity, that
supports itself. At one period I preached and read five times
on a Sunday, and rode sixteen miles. But what did it cost
me? Nothing! Yet most men would have looked on, while
I was rattling from village to village, with all the dogs barking
at my heels, and would have called me a hero; whereas, if
they were to look at me now, they would call me an idle,
lounging fellow. “He gets into his study (they would say)&mdash;he
walks from end to end&mdash;he scribbles on a scrap of paper&mdash;he
throws it away and scribbles on another&mdash;he sits down&mdash;scribbles
again&mdash;walks about!” They cannot see that here
is an exhaustion of the spirit which, at night, will leave me
worn to the extremity of endurance. They cannot see the
numberless efforts of mind which are crossed and stifled, and
recoil on the spirits like the fruitless efforts of a traveller to
get firm footing among the ashes on the steep sides of Mount
Etna.&mdash;<cite>Rev. John Todd&mdash;Student’s Guide.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Necessity of a Steadfast Character.</span>&mdash;The man who
is perpetually hesitating which of two things he will do first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
will do neither. The man who resolves, but suffers his resolution
to be changed by the first counter-suggestion of a
friend&mdash;who fluctuates from opinion to opinion, from plan to
plan&mdash;and veers, like a weathercock, to every point of the
compass, with every breath of caprice that blows&mdash;can never
accomplish anything great or useful. Instead of being progressive
in anything, he will be at best stationary, and more
probably retrograde, in all. It is only the man who first
consults wisely, then resolves firmly, and then executes his
purpose with inflexible perseverance, undismayed by those
petty difficulties which daunt a weaker spirit&mdash;that can advance
to eminence in any line. Let us take, by way of illustration,
the case of a student. He commences the study of
the dead languages; but presently a friend comes, and tells
him that he is wasting his time, and that, instead of obsolete
words, he had much better employ himself in acquiring new
ideas. He changes his plan, and sets to work at the mathematics.
Then comes another friend, who asks him, with
a grave and sapient face, whether he intends to become a
professor in a college; because, if he does not, he is misemploying
his time; and that, for the business of life, common
mathematics is quite enough of mathematical science.
He throws up his Euclid, and addresses himself to some
other study, which in its turn is again relinquished, on some
equally wise suggestion: and thus life is spent in changing
his plans. You cannot but perceive the folly of this course;
and the worse effect of it is, the fixing on your mind a habit
of indecision, sufficient of itself to blast the fairest prospects.
No&mdash;take your course wisely, but firmly: and having taken
it, hold upon it with heroic resolution; and the Alps and
Pyrenees will sink before you&mdash;the whole empire of learning
will lie at your feet; while those who set out with you, but
stopped to change their plans, are yet employed in the very
profitable business of changing their plans. Let your motto
be <em>Perseverance</em>. Practise upon it, and you will be convinced
of its value by the distinguished eminence to which it will
conduct you.&mdash;<cite>Wirt’s Essays.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Ill Temper.</span>&mdash;Mankind are ignorant enough, both in the
mass, about general interests, and individually, about the
things which belong to their peace; but of all mortals none
perhaps are so awfully self-deluded as the unamiable. They
do not, any more than others, sin for the sake of sinning; but
the amount of woe caused by their selfish unconsciousness is
such as may well make their weakness an equivalent for other
men’s gravest crimes. There are great diversities of hiding-places
for their consciences&mdash;many mansions in the dim prison
of discontent; but it may be doubted whether, in the hour
when all shall be uncovered to the eternal day, there will be
revealed a lower deep than the hell which they have made.
They perhaps are the only order of evil ones who suffer hell
without seeing and knowing that it is hell. But they are under
a heavier curse even than this; they inflict torments, second
only to their own, with an unconsciousness almost worthy
of spirits of light. While they complacently conclude themselves
the victims of others, or pronounce that they are too
singular, or too refined, for common appreciation, they are
putting in motion an enginery of torture whose aspect will
one day blast their minds’ sight. The dumb groans of their
victims will sooner or later return upon their ears from the
heights of the heaven to which the sorrows of men daily ascend.
The spirit sinks under the prospect of the retribution of the
unamiable; if there be indeed an eternal record&mdash;an impress
on some one or other human spirit&mdash;of every chilling frown,
of every querulous tone, of every bitter jest, of every insulting
word&mdash;of all abuses of that tremendous power which mind has
over mind. The throbbing pulses, the quivering nerves, the
wrung hearts, that surround the unamiable&mdash;what “a cloud
of witnesses” is here! and what plea shall avail against them?
The terror of innocents who should know no fear&mdash;the vindictive
emotions of dependents who dare not complain&mdash;the
faintness of heart of life-long companions&mdash;the anguish of
those who love&mdash;the unholy exultation of those who hate&mdash;what
an array of judges is here! and where can an appeal be
lodged against their sentence? Is pride of singularity a rational
plea? Is super-refinement, or circumstance from God,
or uncongeniality in man, a sufficient ground of appeal, when
the refinement of one is a grace granted for the luxury of all,
when circumstance is given to be conquered, and uncongeniality
is appointed for discipline? The sensualist has brutified
the seraphic nature with which he was endowed&mdash;the depredator
has intercepted the rewards of toil, marred the image
of justice, and dimmed the lustre of faith in men’s minds&mdash;the
imperial tyrant has invoked a whirlwind to lay waste,
for an hour of God’s eternal year, some region of society.
But the unamiable&mdash;the domestic torturer&mdash;has heaped wrong
on wrong and woe on woe, through the whole portion of
time that was given him, until it would be rash to say that
there are any others more guilty than he. If there be hope
or solace for the domestic torturer, it is that there may have
been tempers about him the opposite of his own. It is matter
of humiliating gratitude that there were some which he could
not ruin, and that he was the medium of discipline by which
they were exercised in forbearance, in divine forgiveness and
love. If there be solace in such an occasional result, let it
be made the most of by those who need it; for it is the only
possible alleviation to their remorse. Let them accept it as
the free gift of a mercy which they have insulted, and a long-suffering
which they have defied.&mdash;<cite>From Deerbrook, a Tale, by
Harriet Martineau.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Slander and Vindication.</span>&mdash;Vindication in some cases
partakes of the same qualities that Homer ascribes to prayer.
Slander, “strong, and sound of wing, flies through the world,
afflicting men;” but Vindication, lame, wrinkled, and imbecile,
for ever seeking its object, and never obtaining it, follows
after, only to make the person in whose behalf it is employed
more completely the scorn of mankind. The charge against
him is heard by thousands, the vindication by few. Wherever
Vindication comes, is not the first thing it tells of the
unhappy subject of it, that his character has been tarnished,
his integrity suspected&mdash;that base motives and vile actions
have been imputed to him&mdash;that he has been scoffed at by
some, reviled by others, and looked at askance by all? Yes;
the worst thing I would wish to my worst enemy is, that his
character should be the subject of vindication. And what is the
well-known disposition of mankind in this particular? All
love the scandal. It constitutes a tale that seizes upon the
curiosity of our species; it has something deep and obscure, and
mysterious in it; it has been whispered from man to man, and
communicated by winks, and nods, and shrugs, the shaking
of the head, and the speaking motion of the finger. But
Vindication is poor, and dry, and cold, and repulsive. It
rests in detections and distinctions, explanations to be given to
the meaning of a hundred phrases, and the setting right whatever
belongs to the circumstances of time and place. What bystander
will bend himself to the drudgery of thoroughly appreciating
it? Add to which, that all men are endowed with the
levelling principle, as with an instinct. Scandal includes in it,
as an element, that change of fortune which is required by the
critic from the writer of an epic poem or a tragedy. The
person respecting whom a scandal is propagated is of sufficient
importance, at least in the eyes of the propagator and
the listener, to be made a subject for censure. He is found,
or he is erected into, an adequate centre of attack; he is first
set up as a statue to be gazed at, that he may afterwards be
thrown down and broken to pieces, crumbled into dust, and
made the prey of all the winds of heaven.&mdash;<cite>Godwin’s
Mandeville.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4">The weather is not a safe topic of discourse; your company
may be hippish; nor is health; your associate may be a hypochondriac;
nor is money; you may be suspected as a borrower.&mdash;<cite>Zimmerman.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4">When all is done, human life is at the best but like a froward
child, that must be played with and humoured a little
to keep it quiet till it falls asleep, and then the care is over.&mdash;<cite>Sir
W. Temple.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4">Time runs on, and when youth and beauty vanish, a fine
lady who had never entertained a thought into which an
admirer did not enter, finds in herself a lamentable void.</p>

a wife knows nothing of domestic duties beyond the parlour
or the boudoir, she is a dangerous partner in these times of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
